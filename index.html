        <h3>Stats</h3>

            <section>
                <p>Every Pokemon has a variable amount that goes into six basic stats</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>HP, or health points, which determines how much damage a Pokemon can take before fainting.</li>
                    <li>ATK, or attack, which determines how much damage is done by a Pokemon's physical attacks.</li>
                    <li>Sp. ATK, or special attack, which is functionally the same as the attack stat, but for special (non-physical) moves.</li>
                    <li>DEF, or defense, which reduces the amount of damage received from physical attacks.</li>
                    <li>Sp. DEF, or special defense, which is functionally the same as defense, but for special attacks.</li>
                    <li>SPD, or speed, which determines the order in which Pokemon attack in a turn.</li>
                </ol>
