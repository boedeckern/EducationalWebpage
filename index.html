                <p>Every Pokemon has a variable amount that goes into six basic stats</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>HP, or health points, which determines how much damage a Pokemon can take before fainting.</li>
                    <li>ATK, or attack, which determines how much damage is done by a Pokemon's physical attacks.</li>
                    <li>Sp. ATK, or special attack, which is functionally the same as the attack stat, but for special (non-physical) moves.</li>
                    <li>DEF, or defense, which reduces the amount of damage received from physical attacks.</li>
                    <li>Sp. DEF, or special defense, which is functionally the same as defense, but for special attacks.</li>
                    <li>SPD, or speed, which determines the order in which Pokemon attack in a turn.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="equationInfo">
                <p>In addition to stats, there are numerous other <a href="./page2.html">effects and moves</a> that can alter the damage formula, shown below.</p>
                <img src="./images/PFormula.webp" alt="Pokemon damage formula"width=50%>
                <p>Level is the attacking Pokemon's level, Power is the move's base power, A is the attacker's attack or special attack, depending on the move, and D is the defender's defense or special defense depending on the move. That formula is then multiplied by a gauntlet of other effects, of which I will not detail here.</p>
